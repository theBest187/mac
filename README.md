# Windows-IPA-builder
Build IPA’s and DMG’s from windows or any device with a browser using a folder! Languages can be edited in /Languages.json, if you want it to only be an iPhone app or macOS app, or ipadOS app, /SupportedDevices.json!
# ***NOTE: all builds done for each app will be in builds/YourAppName.ipa or .dmg***
theres no need for creating any xcode folders (aka no need for creating .xcarchive and no need for creating .xcodeproj, just run the workflow and itll create .xcodeproj, and then turns it into .xcarchive, puts it into builds/, then builds the apple apps)
